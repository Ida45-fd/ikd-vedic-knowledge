            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Vedic Mathematics was rediscovered by Indian mathematician Jagadguru Shri Bharati Krishna Tirthaji between 1911 and 1918. He was a Sanskrit, math, history, and philosophy expert. From 1925 until 1960, he was also the Shankaracharya (spiritual head) of Puri. He spent several years researching the Vedas and other ancient manuscripts, claiming to have discovered a cohesive mathematical system concealed within them.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Bhūtasaṃkhyā System</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Bhūtasaṃkhyā</strong> system is a method of recording numbers in Sanskrit using common nouns having connotations of numerical values. This method was introduced in astronomical texts in antiquity but was expanded and developed during the medieval period. As a kind of rebus system, bhūtasaṃkhyā has also been called the "concrete number notation."</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p>For example, the number "two" was associated with the word "eye" because every human being has two eyes. Thus, every Sanskrit word meaning "eye" could denote "two." Similarly, all words synonymous with "earth" could signify the number "one," as there is only one earth.</p>
            </div>

        <section>
            <h2>The Kaṭapayādi System</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Kaṭapayādi system</strong> (<em>Devanagari:</em> कटपयादि), also known as <em>Paralppēru</em> (<em>Malayalam:</em> പരല്‍പ്പേര്), is an ancient Indian alphasyllabic numeral system. It depicts letters as numerals for easy remembrance of numbers as words or verses. By assigning more than one letter to one numeral and nullifying certain letters as valueless, this system allows the formation of meaningful, memorable words out of numbers.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Binary Numbers and Pingala</h2>
            <p><strong>Acharya Pingala</strong> discovered the immense possibilities of binary numbers while studying the meter or <em>Chandah</em> of the Vedas. The Vedas were composed in meters or <em>Chandah</em>, which are based on combinations of long (<em>dheerga</em>) and short (<em>laghu</em>) sounds. This foundation of Sanskrit prosody led Pingala to stumble upon the concept of the binary number system.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p>In the 3rd century BCE, Pingala authored a work called <em>Chandahsastra</em>, meaning the science of meters as used in poetry and music. This work laid the groundwork for understanding binary systems.</p>

            <h2>Pāṇini and Sanskrit Grammar</h2>
            <p><strong>Pāṇini</strong> (Sanskrit: पाणिनि) was a Sanskrit grammarian, logician, and philologist revered as a scholar in ancient India. He is variously dated between the 7th and 4th centuries BCE. His most important work, the <em>Aṣṭādhyāyī</em>, is a grammatical treatise on the Sanskrit language.</p>

            <p>The <em>Aṣṭādhyāyī</em> is descriptive and generative, with algebraic-like rules governing every aspect of the language. Supplemented by three ancillary texts—the <em>akṣarasamāmnāya</em>, <em>dhātupāṭha</em>, and <em>gaṇapāṭha</em>—it is a comprehensive guide to Sanskrit grammar. Modeled on the dialect of elite speakers of the time, the text also accounts for features of the older Vedic language.</p>

            <h2>The Sulba Sutras</h2>
            <p>The Sulba Sutras, which are part of the Kalpa Sutras (ritual manuals), contain the majority of the Vedic mathematical knowledge. The Sulba Sutras are concerned with the building of altars and geometric shapes for sacrifice rites. They also include early instances of algebraic equations, the Pythagorean theorem, irrational numbers, square roots, and pi.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Vedic Maths Sutras</h2>
            <p>The sixteen sutras (word-formulas), and thirteen sub-sutras that constitute the foundation of Vedic mathematics each offer precise solutions for a variety of mathematical problems. These approaches are applicable to addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as other mathematical operations.</p>
